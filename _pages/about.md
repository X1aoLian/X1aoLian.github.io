I am currently a third-year PhD candidate in Data Science at **William & Mary**, advised by [Dr. Yi He](https://yhe15.people.wm.edu/).

Previously, I completed my Master's degree at **University of Nottingham** in the UK in 2019, following my undergraduate studies at **Dalian Maritime University** in China from 2013 to 2017.

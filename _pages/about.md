I am currently a third-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at **Old Dominion University**, advised by [Dr. Yi He](https://www.lions.odu.edu/~y1he/index.html).

Previously, I completed my Master's degree at **University of Nottingham** in the UK in 2018, following my undergraduate studies at **Dalian Maritime University** in China from 2013 to 2017.
